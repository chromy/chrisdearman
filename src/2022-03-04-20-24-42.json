Hereafter shall be  referred to as my client. \r\n \r\nOn the 29th  December  2009, my client, his husband and their three  children were involved in a car accident. All occupants of the vehicle unfortunately lost their lives. Since then I have made several enquiries to your embassy to locate any of my clients extended  relatives. \r\n \r\nAfter these several unsuccessful attempts, I decided to track his last  name over the Internet, to locate any member of his family hence I  contacted you. \r\n \r\nThe finance company where the deceased had an account valued at about  9.5 million euros has issued me a notice to provide the next of kin or have the account confiscated within the next ten  official working days. \r\n \r\nSincerely, \r\nBarrister   Paco  Martinez (Esq) \r\nTel/Fax:  0034-604-197-938 \r\nReply To:  Pacomartinezconsultant@gmail.com",
